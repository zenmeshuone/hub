Hong Kong and Paris are now tied with Singapore as the world's most-expensive cities to live, the first time that three cities have been tied for first place in the 30-year history of the Economist Intelligence Unit's 2019 Worldwide Cost of Living Survey. 
Hong Kong moved up three places to join Singapore, which has been the world's most-expensive place to live for the last five years. Paris, which has been one of the top 10 since 2003, moved up this year from the second most-expensive last year. Paris, Singapore and Hong Kong are all 7 per cent more expensive to live than New York, the benchmark city. 
The survey released on Tuesday compares the cost of 160 items, such as food, drink, transport, utility bills, and rent, in 133 cities. The top 10 most expensive cities are largely dominated by Asian and European cities. 
Japan's Osaka moved up six positions, and now shares fifth place with Switzerland's Geneva. 
New York and Los Angeles are the only North American cities in the top 10, with the Big Apple rising six spots to seventh place, a position it shares with Denmark's Copenhagen.
