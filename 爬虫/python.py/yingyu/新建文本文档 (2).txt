Turkey's Istanbul has become considerably less expensive, dropping 48 places to 120th on the list due in part to the decrease in value of Turkish lira. Moscow is down 16 spots to 102nd. 
The cheapest cities to live in were largely made up of those experiencing political or economic disruption (or both in same cases). Caracas, Venezuela's capital was at the very bottom of the list this year, a position previously occupied by Damascus in war-torn Syria. Deteriorating economic conditions in Venezuela and hyperinflation are at the root of its position on the list.
