Los Angeles was named the 10th most-expensive city in the world, along with Israel's Tel Aviv. San Francisco has also become a more expensive place to live, rising 12 positions to 25th place. 
The cost of living in the UK has also increased. A surge in domestic prices, pushing London up eight positions to 22nd, is a main factor. 
According to the survey, US cities were among the priciest when it came to utilities and domestic help. 
Swiss cities Zurich and Geneva, coming in at fourth and joint fifth (with Osaka) respectively, had the highest costs when it came to household, personal care, recreation and entertainment expenses.
